# Hypermerge

Hypermerge is a high-level API for building collaborative document editing experiences over peer-to-peer networks.

It is built on top of the [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) data structure and the [Hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore) distributed append-only log from the [Dat project](https://datproject.org/).

Automerge is a new Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type
  ([CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)). It is based on [academic research on JSON CRDTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03960) (but some details are different from the paper).

It uses the the [multicore](README-multicore.md) library to manage many hypercores that can be replicated.
